                    A Task Tracker website built using .NET and C# with MySQL as the database is a web-based application
                    that allows managers or supervisors to assign tasks to employees and track their progress. This
                    website enables team members to stay organized and helps increase productivity.
                    <br>
                    With a Task Tracker website, managers or supervisors can create and assign tasks to specific
                    employees or teams, set due dates, and add descriptions or attachments to provide detailed
                    instructions. Employees can access the website to view their assigned tasks, mark them as complete,
                    and leave comments or notes for their manager or supervisor.
                    <br>
                    The website can also include features such as real-time notifications, status updates, and a
                    dashboard that displays the progress of each task and provides an overview of the team's
                    performance.
                    <br>
                    As the website is built using .NET and C# with MySQL as the database, it is a secure and reliable
                    solution for tracking tasks and managing teams. The use of modern web technologies ensures that the
                    website is fast, responsive, and user-friendly. Additionally, the database provides a scalable and
                    efficient storage solution for managing tasks and team data.

                    The application features a user-friendly interface that allows users to create profiles, search for
                    available rides, and request to join or offer rides based on their preferences and schedules.
                    Car-Pooling provides a secure and reliable platform for users to connect and communicate, ensuring
                    trust and transparency among participants.
                    <br>
                    The application utilizes advanced algorithms to optimize routes and match users with compatible
                    travel companions, maximizing the efficiency of each trip. Users can also rate and review each
                    other, promoting accountability and fostering a community of responsible carpoolers.
                    <br>
                    Car-Pooling promotes sustainable transportation options, cost-sharing, and social connections,
